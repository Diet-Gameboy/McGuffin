# McGuffin Ï€

Phoenix Cushman's MCGuffin.
Produced from Summer 2020 - Summer 2025.

McGuffin is an adventure game using an ASCII art style. The goal of the game is to explore the world traveling through different zones and collecting items. You use the various items to complete quests with the locals until you recover the sacred McGuffins from the four rulers of the zones. Once all four McGuffins have been collected you win!

# Assembling

To assemble the main mcguffin.8xk file first clone the repository.
Then add an "asm" folder to the main directory with your assembler of choice inside, an empty "build" folder to the main directory, and then tweak the makefile accordingly.
You can then run the makefile to build the application

    make mcguffin
There is also a clock demo and level viewer app which can be assembled like so

    make clock_demo

    make level_viewer
Or you can make all of them in one go
    
    make all

I recommend spasm-ng and have a link below in the resources.
